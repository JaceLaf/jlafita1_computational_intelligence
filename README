Computational Intelligence for the Humanities
Repository created: 2/19/2025
Class taken: Spring 2025

This is a repository of all my code from my Computational Intelligence class.
Most of this will be tokenization, language modeling, and other humanities-related research.
Will update this file with details of my final project.
